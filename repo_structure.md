# Repository Structure Analysis

This repository contains a news article classification project. Here are all the files present and their purposes:

## Main Application Files
1. `app.py` - A Flask application that provides the backend API endpoints.
2. `ui.py` - A Streamlit-based user interface that interacts with the Flask backend.
3. `train_model.py` - Script for training the news classification model using the dataset.

## Utility Files (in util/ directory)
1. `util/preprocess.py` - Contains text preprocessing functions using NLTK for cleaning and preparing news article text.
2. `util/read_csv.py` - Utility functions for reading CSV data files.

## Configuration and Documentation
1. `README.md` - Project documentation explaining the news article classification system.
2. `requirements.txt` - Lists project dependencies including Flask and Streamlit.

## Data Directory
- The code references a `data/flipitnews-data.csv` file which appears to contain the news article dataset.

I have opened and reviewed all Python files (.py) and configuration files in the repository root and util/ directory. The structure suggests this is a complete implementation of a news classification system with separate backend (Flask) and frontend (Streamlit) components, along with data processing utilities.
