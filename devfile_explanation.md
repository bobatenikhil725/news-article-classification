# Devfile.yaml Explanation

The `devfile.yaml` file in this project is a configuration file that defines the development environment and workflow. Here's what each section contains:

1. **Schema Version** (`schemaVersion: 2.0.0`)
   - Specifies the version of the devfile schema being used

2. **Metadata**
   - `name: python-flask-app` - The name of the project
   - `version: 1.0.0` - The version of the project

3. **Components**
   - Defines a container component named "dev"
   - Uses AWS MDE universal image from public ECR (`public.ecr.aws/aws-mde/universal-image:latest`)

4. **Commands**
   - Defines two commands that can be executed in the development environment:
     1. `install`: Runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install project dependencies
     2. `test`: Runs `python -m pytest` to execute the test suite

This devfile is used to ensure consistent development environments and provides standardized commands for common development tasks like installing dependencies and running tests.
